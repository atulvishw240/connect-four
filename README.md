# Connect Four

To learn more about the game and it's rules [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

## Objective

To learn TDD (Test Driven Development).

## Difficulties

Implementing the game itself was an easy task, as it's quite similar to Tic Tac Toe. Tricky part was to do it in TDD fashion.

I had to google a lot about, "Ok I know what behavior I want but How will I test it?".

## Learnings

1. I learned about the importance of writing Pure functions as they are easy to test and leads to better design.

2. I learned about Mocking and how it can be used to separate other class functionalities, from the class, which is being tested.

3. I learned that TDD is a discipline, its quite hard to write just enough code to pass the tests.
